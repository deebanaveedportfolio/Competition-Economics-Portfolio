# Market Competition Simulation

**Objective:**  
Simulate oligopolistic market scenarios to evaluate the impact of pricing, product differentiation, and competitive behavior on market outcomes.

**Tools Used:**  
R, ggplot2, dplyr

**Methods:**  
- Regression analysis and basic econometric modeling  
- Simulated market datasets to evaluate market concentration and consumer impacts  
- Created visualizations of price, demand, and market share dynamics  

**Key Outputs:**  
- Interactive charts and static plots illustrating competitive effects  
- KPI summaries for market efficiency and consumer welfare  

**Files:**  
- market_simulation.R — R script with reproducible analysis  
- market_charts.png — sample visualization of market outcomes

**Skills Applied:**  
Market Simulation, Regression Analysis, KPI Tracking, R, Data Visualization

**How to Run:**  
1. Open `market_simulation.R` in R or RStudio.  
2. Run the script — all charts and regression tables generate automatically from simulated data.
